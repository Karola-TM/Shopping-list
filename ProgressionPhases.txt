Suggested progression (MVP → AI enhancements)

MVP
Create/Read/Update/Delete (CRUD) shopping list items.
Persist locally (browser localStorage / SQLite) and optionally sync to a simple backend.
Basic UI: add item, mark bought, delete, clear list.


Phase 1 — small AI improvements
Natural-language entry: let users type “two cartons of milk and eggs” and parse into items/quantities.
Smart autocomplete / suggestions from past lists.
Auto-categorize items (dairy, produce, household).
Example benefit: faster entry, fewer taps.

Phase 2 — richer AI features
Recipe-to-shopping-list: paste a recipe, extract ingredients & amounts.
Personalization: recommend frequently-bought items or recipes based on history.
Voice input (speech-to-text + natural-language parsing).
Receipt OCR to add items from a photo (advanced).

Phase 3 — integrations & advanced
Price comparison across stores, real-time coupons.
Pantry tracking + expiration reminders.
Offline-first sync and conflict resolution.
